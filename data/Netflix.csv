I do not think i have to say anymore than adverts are annoying, i pay for netflix so therefore i expect there to be no adverts. If there were no ads i would give it a 4 star.",2

My kids live with me 50% of the time, now the app doesn't work on their smart devices because it thinks they don't live here.

For just one month my subscription payment got late due to low funds in my bank account I tried restarting the membership when they were enough but netflix didn't accept that. I tried making another account but it will not even accept my debit card now. Then I made another account with a new debit card information but it still says about having not enough funds even if they are more than enough. Chat support team is also of no help. Frustrated.,1

How about introducing a feature where users can opt to turn their front cameras and start a conversation while watching the same content?

It would add an exciting social element to the platform, making users feel closer even when they're physically apart.",5

40d51e6d-31fc-4a52-b1ba-cb638cf41eda,I am using Netflix since 2 years . But I have cancelled autopayment last month and again tried to take membership of 149/- for mobile . Payment have been cut from my account once but again after opening the app it said YOUR PAYMENT IS PENDING . I thought I have done some sort of mistake and again paid 149/- but again it is saying the same . Some are saying RUPAY card is not accepted by netflix but I have used UPI even though it is saying the same damn thing,3

Upon launching the app, I encountered constant issues with video playback. No matter what I tried, whether it was restarting the app or my device, the videos simply refused to play.I thought maybe it was just a temporary glitch, but after several attempts over different days, the problem persisted. It's incredibly frustrating to have a streaming service that can't deliver on its basic function",5

Poor acting, disgusting voice overs that are cringe to listen and what's more, anything remotely good always leaves days or weeks after launching. This needs to be addressed, this is not how nextflix use to be in the beginning but money has definitely changed them, no more effort, no addition to add on whats already there, no nothing. They just seem to be money hounds at this point and that's just sad.",1

dc84b02b-f2a0-4058-a0a5-d799548a1a37,Netflix has decided punishing long time subscribers is in its best interests. I'm an over the road truck driver and Netflix has decided I'm stealing access because I'm logged in using a moble device and occasionally connect to free wifi using the same device. Apparently now I have to keep requesting access codes so that I can use my Netflix subscription. I don't have a home internet to access netflix on and reconcile your bs security I have a TV but guess what it uses the same mobile net.,1
